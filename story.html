    <h2 class="story head1">The past</h2>
    <p class="story story1">The Story starts in the small continent of Randon, a bustling country that is at peace. The humanoid races and the demon races live in harmony and strive to continue. After many years of constant peace, a demon overcome by the drive to become the strongest, decided to create an army of demon kin just like him. He called himself the first demon lord, a cheesy name in hindsight that would eventually become a name of true fear. His plan at the time was to train with the restricted dark magic without anyone knowing and when the time came his group of demons and himself would overtake the king of Rondon and steal his thrown. After years of lying in wait and practicing the forbidden magic the first demon lord sprung his plan into action. The dark magic allowed him to enhance his troops at the cost of them going into a rage, and this allowed him to break into the capital and to face off against the king. The king who up until this point trully had a good relationship with demon kind, faced off against the new demon lord. After a long fought battle the king stood the winner, declaring that he was going to close the borders to the demon realm and that they were traitors. Thus began the demon kings full rise to power, he had hoped to win but if he didnt he left a note for his other followers to read, asking them to continue to take up the mantle and fight against the king until we win.</p>
